use of HTTP status codes.

[[overview_errors]]
== Errors
=== Validation error
Whenever a request body violate constraints, a validation error response with status code 400 is returned. The response body will contain a JSON object that describes the validation errors. The object has the following structure:
include::{snippets}/validation-error-example/response-body.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/validation-error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Generic error
Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:
include::{snippets}/generic-error-example/response-body.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/generic-error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

[[overview-hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

RESTful API uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application
from resource to resource.
Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate.
